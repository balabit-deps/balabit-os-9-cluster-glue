+# Cluster Glue
+
+Cluster Glue is a set of libraries, tools and utilities used in the
+the Heartbeat/Pacemaker cluster stack. In essence, Glue are the parts
+of the cluster stack that don't fit in anywhere else, and aren't big
+enough pieces or actively developed enough to qualify as their own
+projects.
+
+Cluster Glue has been managed as a separate Linux-HA sub-project since
+its 1.0 release, which coincided with the Heartbeat 2.99
+release. Previously, it was a part of the then-monolithic Heartbeat
+project, and had no separate name.
+
+## Components
+
+### Local Resource Manager (LRM)
+
+The Local Resource Manager is the interface between the Cluster
+Resource Manager (Pacemaker) and the resource agents. It is itself not
+cluster aware, nor does it apply any policies. It simply processes
+commands received from the Cluster Resource Manager, passes them to
+resource agents, and reports back success or failure. It particular,
+the LRM may
+
+* start a resource;
+* stop a resource;
+* monitor a resource;
+* report a resource's status;
+* list all resource instances it currently controls, and their status.
+
+### STONITH
+
+A mechanism for node fencing. In case a node is considered "dead" by
+the cluster as a whole, STONITH ("Shoot The Other Node In The Head")
+forcefully removes is from the cluster so it can no longer pose a risk
+of interacting with other nodes in an uncoordinated fashion.
+
+### hb_report (deprecated)
+
+An advanced error reporting utility. hb_report-generated tarballs are
+frequently requested by the developers to isolate and fix bugs, and
+are commonly found as attachments to Bugzilla entries.
+
+NOTE: hb_report has been integrated into
+[https://crmsh.github.io](crmsh), and is now maintained as part of the
+`crmsh` project.
+
+### Cluster Plumbing Library
+
+A low-level library for intra-cluster communications.
+
+## Source Code Repository
+
+Source code for Cluster Glue is being maintained in the
+https://github.com/ClusterLabs/cluster-glue git repository.
